    <h1>About Sharon</h1>
    <h2>The Gist</h2>
      <p>I am currently a senior in industrial design at RISD.
      Outside of design, I enjoy drawing comics, editing videos,
      and playing Old School Runescape.
      Usually, you can find me occupied by a random topic
      (I have been researching a lot into Jungian cognitive functions
      recently).
      I enjoy watching a variety of shows, some including The Office,
      Silicon Valley and Rick and Morty. </p>
