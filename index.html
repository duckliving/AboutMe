    <h1>About Sharon</h1>
    <h2>The Gist</h2>
      <p>I am currently a senior in industrial design at RISD.
      Outside of design, I enjoy drawing
      <a href="http://readduckliving.com">comics</a>, editing
      <a href="http://youtube.com/duckliving">videos</a>,
      weight lifting, and playing Old School Runescape.
      Usually, you can find me occupied by a random topic
      (I have been researching a lot into Jungian cognitive functions
      recently).
      I am always on the path of self improvement,
      and most recently I am running 6ks and quitting caffeine.
      I enjoy watching a variety of shows, some including The Office,
      Silicon Valley and Rick and Morty. </p>

      (You can find me in cafes and on the couch, etc.)
